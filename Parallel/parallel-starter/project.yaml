  # This endpoint must be a public non-pruned archive node
  # Public nodes may be rate limited, which can affect indexing speed
  # When developing your project we suggest getting a private API key
  # You can get them from OnFinality for free https://app.onfinality.io

    ["wss://parallel.api.onfinality.io/public-ws", "wss://rpc.parallel.fi"]
  # Optionally provide the HTTP endpoint of a full chain dictionary to speed up processing
